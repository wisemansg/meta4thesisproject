## 📑 Abstract

Electric vehicles are central to the global transition toward low emission mobility. Aluminum has become a key material in electric vehicle manufacturing due to its lightweight properties, recyclability and structural performance benefits. However, aluminum production is highly energy intensive and exhibits environmental variations depending on electricity mix, recycling rates, process routes and regional industrial infrastructure. This thesis assesses the environmental impacts of aluminum production for electric vehicles using Life Cycle Assessment and predictive modeling to identify optimization strategies with the potential to reduce emissions and resource burdens.

The study compares primary aluminum produced from bauxite with secondary aluminum produced via recycling and incorporates regional electricity variations to assess renewable based and fossil based smelting pathways. Life Cycle Assessment was conducted using SimaPro with datasets from Ecoinvent and published industrial literature. A predictive modeling component was implemented to explore scenarios involving energy mix changes, circularity improvements and industrial efficiency gains. Results show that recycled aluminum uses significantly less energy and emits substantially fewer greenhouse gases compared to primary aluminum. Renewable electricity such as hydropower leads to considerably lower emissions than coal based smelting. Scenario modeling indicates that combining renewable energy with closed loop recycling yields the strongest sustainability gains for electric vehicle materials.

Overall, aluminum supports sustainable mobility when paired with circularity and clean energy but does not inherently guarantee low environmental impact. The research highlights the importance of supply chain electrification, recycling infrastructure and data informed industrial decision making.
